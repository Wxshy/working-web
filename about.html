        <p>Hello There, I am a college student in the UK studying Computer Science, Physical Education and Psyhcology. I am going to university in september of 2021 to study Software Engineering.
            <br> <br>99% of my life is sport, whether it is tackling people in hockey, scoring sixes in cricket or climbing hills on my bike - if it 's sports i'll be there! I was fortunate enought to have played for the England Under 16s squad in the
            2018/19 season where we won the Home Nations. I am also an avid cyclist and plan to go over into Europe and take on some climbs. I do also love to play cricket from time to time as it gives me some rest and able to socialise while playing.
            <br><br> The other 1% of my free-time is taken up by programming. I started off programming in Year 10 where I learned the basics of Python, which has become my main language as I feel comforatble with the syntax and have learned some of it
            's libraries. I am now trying to branch of into other areas such as web design - which is how this website came about by using HTML, CSS & JS. I am also starting to learn C++ to expand my knowledge.</p>
